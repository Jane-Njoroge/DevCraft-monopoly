# DEVCRAFT MONOPOLY- FRONTEND
**Monopoly** is a real estate trading board game where players buy, sell, and trade properties, aiming to bankrupt their opponents. The game is typically played by 2-8 players and involves rolling dice, purchasing properties, and dealing with various game events, such as paying rent, drawing Chance or Community Chest cards, or landing on "Go to Jail."

- This is the frontend for the **DevCraft Monopoly** game, a web-based implementation of the classic board game **Monopoly**. The frontend allows users to play the game in a browser, interact with various game components, and manage game state.
